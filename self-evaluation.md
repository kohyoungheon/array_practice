##### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel pretty comfortable with arrays. Sometimes I have trouble remembering all the different possible methods you can call on arrays and what exactly they return. 

##### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I really need to practice nested arrays. I think nested arrays are really confusing and they make my head hurt.

##### What questions do you have about Arrays?

What exactly does the documentation mean when methods with a ! bang symbol may permanently mutate the caller. Its hard to picture because in the assignments we do, we hardcode the values into the arrays. Wouldnt the array go back to its original assigned value everytime we re-run the program?
